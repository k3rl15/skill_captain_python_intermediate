Reading files

To Do

Concept:

Reading files in Python is a common operation for processing and extracting information from text files or other types of files.

Here's an example of reading a text file in Python:

    # Open the file in read mode
    file = open("filename.txt", "r")

    # Read the contents of the file
    content = file.read()

    # Close the file
    file.close()

    # Print the content of the file
    print(content)
    

1. In this example, we first open the file using the `open()` function, specifying the file name and the mode as "r" (With quotes duh!) for read mode.
2. Then, we use the `read()` method to read the entire contents of the file and store it in the `content` variable.
3. After reading the file, it's important to close it using the `close()` method to free up system resources.
4. Finally, we print the content of the file using the `print()` function.
5. You can replace `"filename.txt"` with the actual file name or the path to the file you want to read.
6. Ensure that the file exists in the specified location.
