Writing files

Concept:

Writing files in Python is a common task when you want to store data or generate output.

Here's a simple example to write data to a file:

Write a Python program that creates a new text file called "output.txt" and writes the numbers 1 to 10 on separate lines in the file.

    # Open the file in write mode
    file = open("output.txt", "w")

    # Write numbers 1 to 10 to the file
    for num in range(1, 11):
        file.write(str(num) + "\n")

    # Close the file
    file.close()

    print("Data written to file successfully.")
