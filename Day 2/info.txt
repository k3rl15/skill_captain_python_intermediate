Classes and Objects

Concept:

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.
In a non-bookish way, class is just a design that we use to create objects.

The object is an instance of a class. It is an entity that we have created using class.
